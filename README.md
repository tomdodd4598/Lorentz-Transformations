A Simple Derivation of the Lorentz Transformations
==================================================


Summary
-------

A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformations used in special relativity. The only prerequisites are knowledge of natural units and spacetime diagrams.

It is entirely possible that I have made a mistake - let me know if you see any potential improvements!
